# Torrent Agent

A cron-based torrent automation system that fetches popular content and automatically downloads torrents based on user preferences.

Uses LLM to turn scraped data into decisions on what torrents to download. Investigate optimal webscraping solution, I think jina.ai or an open source alternative is best. 

Intent is for people to use localLLM or frontier model via API key.
